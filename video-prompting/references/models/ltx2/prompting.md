# LTX-2 Prompting Guide

## Overview

LTX-2 responds best to story-driven prompts that flow from start to end. Use clear cinematography language, describe the scene and action sequence, and keep it readable and grounded.

## Required Prompt Style

- Write a single flowing paragraph.
- Use present tense verbs.
- Aim for 4 to 8 descriptive sentences.
- Match detail to shot scale (closeups need more specific detail than wide shots).
- Describe motion as a sequence (beginning -> middle -> end).

## Key Aspects to Include

1. Establish the shot: shot type, genre, or cinematography style.
2. Set the scene: lighting, color palette, textures, atmosphere.
3. Describe the action: a clear, natural sequence.
4. Define characters: age, hairstyle, clothing, distinguishing details.
5. Express emotion via physical cues (posture, gesture, facial expression).
6. Camera movement: how the camera moves relative to the subject.
7. Audio and dialogue: ambient sound, music, speech; put spoken lines in quotation marks and mention language/accent if needed.

## For Best Results

- Keep the prompt cohesive and focused on one primary shot.
- Be specific about camera movement and what is revealed after the move.
- Iterate and refine; LTX-2 supports fast experimentation.

## What Works Well With LTX-2

- Cinematic compositions with thoughtful lighting and natural motion.
- Single-subject emotional moments and subtle gestures.
- Atmosphere and setting details (fog, mist, rain, reflections, ambient textures).
- Clean, readable camera directions (slow dolly in, handheld tracking, over-the-shoulder).
- Stylized aesthetics named early (noir, analog film, painterly, surreal).
- Lighting and mood control (backlighting, soft rim light, color palettes).
- Voice: characters can talk and sing in various languages.

## What to Avoid

- Internal state labels without visual cues ("sad", "confused").
- Readable text or logos; avoid signage or brand names.
- Complex physics or chaotic motion (non-linear, fast-twisting actions).
- Too many characters or layered actions.
- Conflicting lighting logic unless clearly motivated.
- Overly complicated prompts; keep it simple and add detail in later iterations.
- Ambiguous acronyms in dialogue. Spell them the way you want them pronounced (e.g., "V-RAM").

## Helpful Terms (Optional)

Use only as needed to support clarity.

- Categories: stop-motion, 2D/3D animation, claymation, hand-drawn, comic book, cyberpunk, pixel art, surreal, minimalist, painterly.
- Visual details: flickering candles, neon glow, natural sunlight, dramatic shadows, rough stone, glossy surfaces, fog, rain, dust.
- Sound and voice: ambient cafe noise, rain and wind, forest ambience, resonant voice, robotic monotone, quiet whisper, mutter, shout.
- Technical style markers: pans, tracks, tilts, pushes in, pulls back, handheld, wide establishing shot, static frame, film grain, motion blur, slow motion, time-lapse.
